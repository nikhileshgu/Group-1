## Scenario Description:
Our movie rental company database demonstrates the management and business operations that include inventory, transactions, membership, customer service, and revenue generation provide a realistic way that a business runs on a day-to-day basis. It improves operational efficiency, improves the accuracy of data with up-to-date tables, and provides insight for the decision making process. The rental data tracking allows for transaction history analysis, the employee management system provides performance evaluation and productivity analysis. The customer management aspect allows us to see the activity status of customers as well as creating personalized services. 

We selected this scenario because it is not your traditional grocery store or shopping mall. It gives us a bit of a “throwback” if you will. This was one of the many options that ChatGPT gave us after prompting it to give us an idea that would meet the guidelines of this project. After coming up with an effective data model idea, we decided that this would be the best database to go with. 

## Data Model:
The data model shows a movie rental store that displays different operational data such as movies, actors, rentals, members, and employee details. 

The Movies entity is the one of the central entities as it contains the movie name, genre, language, main actor, and release date. Each of these attributes connect to the other entities and are a crucial part to the data model. This connects to the Actors entity which creates a many-to-many relationship through Actors_in_Movies which features actors in multiple movies, and movies with multiple actors. 

The Rentals (rental transactions) entity tracks all the checkouts, capturing the rental price, checkout date, return date, and associated Member and Employee that is involved in the transaction. The Members entity has details of the customer who rented the movies with their contact information, status, and membership join date. 

The movie rentals are tracked through the Movies_CheckedOut table which creates a many-to-many relationship between the Movies and Rentals entities. This ensures that a rental transaction can include multiple movies and each movie can be a part of a different rental transaction. 

Lastly, the Employees entity handles the staff members that are responsible for rental transactions. This table includes their first name, last name, and position. Each employee is linked to different rental transactions through a one-to-many relationship. This simply means that the one employee can handle multiple rentals, but each rental is processed by one employee. 

This data model shows how our movie rental business can efficiently track movie availability, customer transactions, and employee involvement to create an organized and profitable rental business.

## Ten Queries:
Query #1- Avg Rental Price by Genre
This query provides the AVG rental price by Genre. We do this by joining our movies table to our weak entity, which is movies_checkedout, then finally joining our weak entity to rentals (rental transactions). We use group by movie genre so we can take the avg rental price of each genre.

<img width="463" alt="Screenshot 2025-03-14 at 10 13 55 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8688dcfb-652c-4532-817d-d8f6b8f066a9" />

<img width="232" alt="Screenshot 2025-03-14 at 10 15 50 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/64a22373-6f62-4054-b718-9ae3a558c91f" />

The average rental transaction price by genre considers the frequency and prices of movies and their genres appearing in rental transactions. Although the store sets the prices, higher average rental transaction prices mean that more movies of that genre are being rented out more frequently and are driving more revenue. Managers would use look at this data and could see that Thriller and War genres are successful, suggesting that they are popular and are priced well.

Query #2 Members who rented more movies than the avg number of rentals + their total rental transactions 

This query is focused on members and the movies they have rented. We join rentals and members through member_id.
Now, we are focusing on the higher value customers that rent out multiple movies over the course of their membership. This shows us the top members by their rental frequency in descending order.
